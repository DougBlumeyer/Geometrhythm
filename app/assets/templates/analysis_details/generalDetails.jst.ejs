<br>adjacent intervals presented vertically and horizontally at the same time.
<br>
<br><strong>full interval content histogram</strong>
<br>all intervals, including internal ones, sorted by size.
<br>
<br><strong>meter</strong>
<br>in terms of quantization to the grid of its cell count.
<br>
<br><strong>symmetry</strong>
<br>agnostic to initial position. properties shared by any rotation or reversal.
<br>
<br><strong>evenness</strong>
<br>in terms of its deviation from a perfectly steady stream of onsets.
<br>
<br><strong>onset</strong>
